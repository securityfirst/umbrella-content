### Use at least 6 randomly chosen words to create a passphrase that is both secure and memorable. 

Computers can crack passwords based on known dictionary words from any language in seconds, and password cracking dictionaries include word variations with capital letters and symbols, as well as famous quotations, song lyrics, poems and common phrases. 

## Use dice

Some people use dice to select words from a specially formatted word list, because humans are bad at thinking randomly. This is known as [diceware](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html). 

Try it with EFF's random number generator [dice](https://www.eff.org/dice) and [word list](https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt).
