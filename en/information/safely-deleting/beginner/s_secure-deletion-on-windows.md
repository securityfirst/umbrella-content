# Bleachbit

Bleachbit is a free, open-source secure deletion tool for Windows. It is much better than the built-in options.

[Download](https://www.bleachbit.org/download/windows) it from the official website and save the file. Double click on the downloaded file to install it. 

## To securely delete a single file or folder:

*    Click the File menu and select Shred Files or Shred Folders.

## To securely delete older data:

*	Click the File menu and select Wipe Free Space.

This will attempt to remove any traces of files you have already deleted by overwriting supposedly empty parts of the hard drive with random data. The process can take a while. 

Documentation is available [here](https://docs.bleachbit.org/).
