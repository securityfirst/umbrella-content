## Hello there!

Umbrella is an open source tool built by Security First - a small NGO based in London and Dublin. In our years of working with high-risk activists around the world we saw the need to make security easier and more accessible - so we decided to come together and do something about it.

Security First also offers physical and digital security training for activists, journalists and aid workers. Our courses cover everything from sending a secure email to conducting physical counter-surveillance and dealing with sensitive sources. We train everyone from large NGOs to high-risk individual activists.

To find out more, contribute in any way (whether code, funding or content), or just let us know what you think, either visit our [website](https://secfirst.org) or email info@secfirst.org. All comments and criticisms welcome - they make us better!
