## General risk factors

*	Conflict in which rape has been used as a weapon; 
* 	Areas in which a government has little or no control; 
* 	A conservative society which restricts contact between unmarried men and women; 
* 	Settings where it is common practice to extort sexual favours. 
*  	The presence of many young men with access to arms.

This could include: 

*	Paramilitaries or police reputed to breach international standards of law; 
*	Undisciplined government soldiers; 
* 	Rebel groups and violent youth movements; 
*	Demobilised, unemployed soldiers; 
* 	Armed criminals who may commit sexual assault if they find a victim while commiting a robbery.

## General risk areas 

*	Districts in which militia operate; 
* 	The area surrounding a refugee camp or the periphery of a camp; 
*	Certain neighbourhoods in a town or city; 
* 	Prisons (men and women detained in police stations or in prison are often victims of rape); 
*  	Certain types of hotels; 
*  	Border crossings and checkpoints. 

## General risk periods

* 	After dark; 
* 	During festivals and celebrations; 
* 	During aid distributions; 
* 	When women go to collect water or firewood or go to the toilet; 
* 	When armed groups are fleeing in defeat; 
* 	When troops enter a town they have just captured. 

## People at risk

Some people may be at higher risk in some contexts. In conflict-ridden environments, there may be a higher risk of gang rape, aggravated assault (i.e. being threatened by weapons) and HIV infection as a result of rape.

*	People of a particular ethnic group; 
* 	People living in an environment where they have few or no social ties; 
*	Western women; 
* 	Widows or female heads of household;
* 	Teenage girls (because they are thought less likely to have HIV);
*  	Marginalized persons, including gender and sexual minorities. 

*Fifty percent (50%) or more of all transgender and gender
non-conforming people have experienced some form of
sexual abuse.* Forge Transgender Sexual Violence Project, ["A Self-Help Guide to Healing and Understanding,"](https://forge-forward.org/wp-content/docs/self-help-guide-to-healing-2015-FINAL.pdf) September 2015.
